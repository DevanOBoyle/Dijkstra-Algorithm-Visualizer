# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

This program is meant to visualize Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. It takes in
an input from the user specifying the size of a 2d matrix along with the starting
and ending coordinates and then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
between the two points. The output is displayed to standard output and marks each
unvisited point with a 0, all visited points with a 1, and the shortest path found
with 2's.

I decided to code this in Python when researching various problems that programmers
commonly deal with. I hope to later improve on this program by having it interactable
on a website where the user can click on squares on a grid to select their starting
and ending points and have the pathfinding play out in real time so that the user can
clearly see how Dijkstra's algorithm works.
